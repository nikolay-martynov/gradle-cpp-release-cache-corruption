= Demonstrates gradle daemon cache corruption with cpp plugin

To reproduce:

```bash
./gradlew --stop ; rm -rf .gradle/ ; ./gradlew clean build ; echo incremental build ; ./gradlew build ; echo releaase ; ./gradlew release ; echo build after release ; ./gradlew clean build ; ./gradlew --stop ; rm -rf .gradle/ ; echo build after cache cleanup ; ./gradlew clean build
```

Notice how build after release fails until cache is deleted manually.

```
Starting a Gradle Daemon, 8 stopped Daemons could not be reused, use --status for details
